# Overview

I am taking my first dive into the C++ programming language, and the creation of this program is for the intent of practicing the syntax of C++ and how learning how it differs from my experience in C and C#, as I'm hoping to gain more experience in this programming language so that I can create bigger and more complex programs.

This program is a simple calculator program that runs a test of each of the four basic mathmatical operators and then allows the user to input any two numbers and calculate the result of a chosen operation.

I chose to create a calculator as a calculator can be both simple and complex, with additional mathematical operations added easily at a later point, allowing me to start off with a new programming language in simplicity, and build up the program at a later point once I have learned the language more.

# Development Environment

This program was made using Visual Studio Code v1.85.2 on a device operating on Windows 11 ARM/x64.

The programming language used in this program is C++, utilizing only the standard library for C++.
